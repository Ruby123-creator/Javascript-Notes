  /**  
   * Primitive values are also immutable. They canâ€™t be changed. Of course, a variable with a primitive assigned can be reassigned. For example, when you write the code let x = 1; x++;, you've reassigned the variable x. But, you haven't mutated the primitive numeric value of 1.

If you ever pass a value into a function, reassigning that value will not modify the value in the calling location. However, if you modify a non-primitive value, the modified value will also be modified where it has been called from.
